            <p>Speaking of which, fifteen years should have passed already!</p>

            <p>His parents of this life were the most ordinary of farmers in Crouching Ox village. Both of them had
                passed away when he was young, and his older brother had raised him. His elder brother was Li Da, so he
                was Li Er<a id="c_kix.hcm7giraq3oh" class="anchor"></a><a href="#kix.hcm7giraq3oh"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>The village was not very sophisticated, so many villagers would spend their entire lives without a proper
                name. He only managed to give himself a proper name thanks to his knowledge from his previous life. He
                was called Li Qingshan<a id="c_kix.dfgos5az0cjm" class="anchor"></a><a
                    href="#kix.dfgos5az0cjm"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>“Must you be buried in your place of home? Sufficient are the green mountains overgrown.” Since he had
                transmigrated, he needed to live a good life, no, a better life than his last. Only then would he not
                waste his second life<a id="c_kix.hhhbp8rg7y9t" class="anchor"></a><a
                    href="#kix.hhhbp8rg7y9t"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

            <p>At this moment, he thought back to his childhood. He had recovered from the fear and confusion from his
                recent transmigration, and the grand ambitions of a transmigrator filled him. However, he soon
                discovered that he was hungry and had not eaten.</p>
